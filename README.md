# SteamCSGOVolume-PriceChecker
Simple app that takes a steam market link and uses an API to get the volume and price over 7 days.
This app is free to use for own projects or inspiration, if you feel like it you can credit me or contact me if you need help with anything.
Big shout out to https://csgobackpack.net/api/ for the nice api!

To use this app you simply go to https://steamcommunity.com/market/ then pick and item from the CS:GO category and copy the part with the name an example is:


STEP 1: Find the item https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/M4A4%20%7C%20Spider%20Lily%20%28Minimal%20Wear%29


STEP 2: Copy this part M4A4%20%7C%20Spider%20Lily%20%28Minimal%20Wear%29


STEP 3: Put in the input field
